<h1>Instagram-Clone</h1>
<p>
   I developed the Instagram-clone interface using the Firebase database. It can successfully register users. The user can access the page. Can add a new post. You can make calls from users registered in the system. In this project, authentication and firestore data have been successfully added to the Firebase database. Data from here was used when necessary.</p>
